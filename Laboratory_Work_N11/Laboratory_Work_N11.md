## Databases Laboratory Work Nr.11


### Prerequisites:
  - Microsoft SQL Server 2012
  - Oracle 11g/12c

### Objectives:
  - T-SQL and Oracle data types and build-in functions
  - SQL Server Data Types and Functions
  - Query and Subquery
  - Agregate Functions
  - While, Try-Catch, If-Else
  - Creating tables and indexes
  - Diagrams, Schemas and Synonyms
  - The administration of Views and common table expressions
  - The stored procedures and defined functions by user
  - Create and using of triggers
  - Restore the database
  
 ### Tasks: 
 
 1. Create a folder 'Backup_lab11'. Execute a full backup of database 'universitatea' in this folder. File of restoring must be
 named exercitiul.bak. Execute SQL instructions. 
 
 2. Write SQL instructions for differential backup which will be named exercitiul2.bak.  
 
 3. Write SQL instructions for log backup whici will be named exercitiul3.bak. 
 
 4. Execute restoring consecutively of all backup files created. The new databse will be named universitatea_lab11. Files of 
 the new database must be located in 'BD_lab11'. Write the SQL instructions.

 **Conclusion :** 

In this laboratory work I obtained skills about backup and how to manage with them. Also, I learned about 3 types of backups : 
Full, Differential and Log, backup of files, copy-only backup. So, doing backups reguarly you save your data and avoid the case of losing the information. Working with
Management SQL Studio I found that it is easy to understand and write T-SQL commands for executing the backups. Moreover, there are several 
types of restoring : from Disk and form stored devices.
